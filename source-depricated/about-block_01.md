# Learn More About the DMTC!

## What is the DMTC?

The DMTC is a registry of curated information about online training and learning resources useful for building competencies, knowledge, skills and abilities in managing, stewarding, curating and preserving research data.  

## Where does DMTC content come from?

The training and learning resources included in the DTMC are created and submitted or gathered by research data skills and management experts.  Curatorial, quality assurance,  and editorial processes are applied to the information about the resources prior to their acceptance into the DMTC.   The training and learning resources themselves are not contained in the DMTC but are linked in the resource descriptions in the DMTC.

The descriptions of resources in the DMTC are designed to help both research data skills trainers and learners discover online training materials that can be used for informal, self-designed learning or supplements to more formal learning curricula.

## What kind of resources are described the DMTC?

The training and learning resources can include online webinars, tutorials, courses with modular units and lessons on specific topics, and educational curriculum guides.  Resources may be associated with specific educational frameworks such as skills, competencies and curricular frameworks, if applicable.   Resource descriptions may also contain annotations and recommendations from previous users, if available.
