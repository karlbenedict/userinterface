There are many data archives for Earth Science data, so there should be one or more that are particularly appropriate for your data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will discuss a few ways that building relationships with archives happen, including discussions about what data you have, where your data will go and how you should go about getting set up with a data archive.

This lesson explores the importance of metadata to data authors, users of the data and organizations, and highlights the utility of metadata.

Keep in mind that there could be several audiences for your data as they move through the entire life cycle. The audiences might reflect various user demographics or various purposes for using the data, and can certainly change over time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDetermining the audiences that use your data can help you identify their needs, and inform the development of your data to meet those needs. Development of the data might include the creation of data products and services that you provide to assist users in using your data.&nbsp; Knowledge of the audiences for your data will help you identify the various products and services that you might offer to current or new user communities, and also help verify that the needs of your users are being met.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEfforts to determine the audiences for your data should continue throughout the entire data life cycle so that you can improve the user experience. Awareness of the initial users of your data can inform the data development process, as well as your plans for disseminating the data and for providing stewardship to manage the data over time. Observations about later users of your data can inform potential improvements for your data, so you can better serve both your current and your future users. &nbsp;This module is available in both presentation slide and video formats.",

As it is a template workshop there is a lot of material to cover all disciplines, it is unlikely that all sections would be of interest to any one group of researchers. The sections are:<br />\r\nIntroduction<br />\r\nBackup and file sharing<br />\r\nHow to organise your data well<br />\r\nData Tools<br />\r\nPersonal and sensitive data<br />\r\nData sharing<br />\r\nData Management Plans<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe workshop works best when adapted for a particular discipline and with a maximum of 30 participants. This workshop was developed for the Data Champions programme at the University of Cambridge and is an adaptation of workshops which are run on a regular basis for PhD students and Postdoctoral researchers. If you would like any more information please email info@data.cam.ac.uk and we would be happy to answer any questions that you have.",

      "abstract_data": "Hydrology researchers are collecting data using in situ sensors at high frequencies, for extended durations, and with spatial distributions that require infrastructure for data storage, management, and sharing. Managing streaming sensor data is challenging, especially in large networks with large numbers of sites and sensors.&nbsp; The availability and utility of these data in addressing scientific questions related to water availability, water quality, and natural disasters relies on effective cyberinfrastructure that facilitates transformation of raw sensor data into usable data products.&nbsp; It also depends on the ability of researchers to share and access the data in useable formats.&nbsp; In this presentation I will describe tools that have been developed for research groups and sites conducting long term monitoring using in situ sensors.&nbsp; Functionality includes the ability to track equipment, deployments, calibrations, and other events related to monitoring site maintenance and to link this information to the observational data that they are collecting, which is imperative in ensuring the quality of sensor-based data products. I will present these tools in the context of a data management and publication workflow case study for the iUTAH (innovative Urban Transitions and Aridregion Hydrosustainability) network of aquatic and terrestrial sensors. &nbsp;iUTAH researchers have developed and deployed an ecohydrologic observatory to monitor Gradients Along Mountain to Urban Transitions (GAMUT). The GAMUT Network measures aspects of water inputs, outputs, and quality along a mountain-to-urban gradient in three watersheds that share common water sources (winter-derived precipitation) but differ in the human and biophysical nature of land-use transitions. GAMUT includes sensors at aquatic and terrestrial sites for real-time monitoring of common meteorological variables, snow accumulation and melt, soil moisture, surface water flow, and surface water quality. I will present the overall workflow we have developed, our use of existing software tools from the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System, and new software tools that we have deployed for both managing the sensor infrastructure and for storing, managing, and sharing the sensor data.",

The goal of this webinar is to provide guidance on fundamental data management practices that investigators should perform during the course of data collection to improve the usability of their data sets.&nbsp; Topics covered will include data structure, quality control, and data documentation. In addition, I will briefly discuss data curation practices that are done by archives to ensure that data can be discovered and used in the future. By following the practices, data will be less prone to error, more efficiently structured for analysis, and more readily understandable for any future questions that they might help address.",

The Digital Heritage Network and the Dutch Coalition on Digital Preservation addresses these issues in three ways:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy raising awareness of (the importance of) PIDs in cultural heritage organisations.<br />\r\nBy increasing the knowledge regarding the use of PIDs within cultural heritage.<br />\r\nBy supporting the technical implementation of PIDs in cultural heritage collection management systems. How we did this on a nationwide scale will be explained in the webinar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are multiple PID systems. But which system is most suited to your situation: Archival Resource Keys (ARKs), Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), Handle, OpenURL, Persistent Uniform Resource Locators (PURLs) or Uniform Resource Names (URNs)? Each system has its own particular properties, strengths and weaknesses. The PID Guide from the Digital Heritage Network&rsquo;s Persistent Identifier project helps you learn and think about important PID subjects, and guides your first steps towards selecting a PID system.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is part 3 of a 3 part series.",

      "abstract_data": "Everybody wants to play FAIR, but how do we put the principles into practice?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a growing demand for quality criteria for research datasets. The presenters argue that the DSA (Data Seal of Approval for data repositories) and FAIR principles get as close as possible to giving quality criteria for research data. They do not do this by trying to make value judgments about the content of datasets, but rather by qualifying the fitness for data reuse in an impartial and measurable way. By bringing the ideas of the DSA and FAIR together, we will be able to offer an operationalization that can be implemented in any certified Trustworthy Digital Repository. In 2014 the FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) were formulated. The well-chosen FAIR acronym is highly attractive: it is one of these ideas that almost automatically get stuck in your mind once you have heard it. In a relatively short term, the FAIR data principles have been adopted by many stakeholder groups, including research funders. The FAIR principles are remarkably similar to the underlying principles of DSA (2005): the data can be found on the Internet, are accessible (clear rights and licenses), in a usable format, reliable and are identified in a unique and persistent way so that they can be referred to. Essentially, the DSA presents quality criteria for digital repositories, whereas the FAIR principles target individual datasets. In this<br />\r\nwebinar the two sets of principles will be discussed and compared and a tangible operationalization will be presented.",

Interactive visualization systems allow scientists, engineers, and biomedical researchers to explore and analyze a variety of phenomena in an intuitive and effective way. The course provides an introduction to the principles and techniques of Scientific Visualization. It covers methods corresponding to the visualization of the most common data types, as well as higher-dimensional, so-called multi-field problems. It combines a description of visualization algorithms with a presentation of their practical application. Basic notions of computer graphics and human visual perception are introduced early on for completeness. Simple but very instructive programming assignments offer a hands-on exposure to the most widely used visualization techniques.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Note that the lectures, demonstration, and tutorial content require a Purdue Credentials,</em><em>Hydroshare</em>, or CILogon account.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccess the CCSM Portal/ESG/ESGC Integration slide presentation at&nbsp; https://mygeohub.org/resources/50/download/ccsm.pdf.

The tool can be used in two ways: first, an end user can use it to dynamically load and explore a csv file of interest. Second, a data owner can use it to build a customized view of the data he wants to share, save the configuration, and publish the data, configuration, and viewer as a new &ldquo;tool&rdquo; specifically for his data.

Many large datasets are only accessible through the systems on which they were created or require specialized software or computational resources for re-use. In response to this growing need, the National Data Service (NDS) consortium is developing the Labs Workbench platform, a scalable, web-based system intended to support turn-key deployment of encapsulated data management and analysis tools to support exploratory analysis and development on cloud resources that are physically &quot;near&quot; the data and associated high-performance computing (HPC) systems. &nbsp;The Labs Workbench may complement existing science gateways by enabling exploratory analysis of data and the ability for users to deploy and share their own tools. The Labs Workbench platform has also been used to support a variety training and workshop environments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis webinar includes a demonstration of the Labs Workbench platform and a discussion of several key use cases. A presentation of findings from the recent Workshop on&nbsp;Container Based Analysis Environments for Research Data Access and Computing further highlight compatibilities between science gateways and interactive analysis platforms such as Labs Workbench.<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

Throughout the last decade, interest in the language has grown alongside researcher&#39;s abilities to collect and store larger amounts of data. Today, scientific and business decisions increasingly rely on the interpretation of this data. New libraries for processing data and communicating results are being debuted in ways that break down traditional language silos. Technologies like interactive documents, HTML based applications, and RESTful APIs have exposed capability gaps between R&#39;s interfaces for numerical analysis libraries and its built-in ability for graphical display. In this webinar, Derrick Kearney will survey several R libraries that are helping people bridge the gap between their R-based analysis and the numerous ways people are representing results today, all of which can be published on your science gateway, thus extending your research impact to others in a reproducible way.",

The core premise of the Jupyter architecture is to design tools around&nbsp;the experience of interactive computing, building an environment, protocol, file format and libraries optimized for the computational process when there is a human in the loop, in a live iteration with ideas and data assisted by the computer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe&nbsp;Jupyter Notebook,&nbsp;a system that allows users to compose rich documents that combine narrative text and mathematics together with live code and the output of computations in any format compatible with a web browser (plots, animations, audio, video, etc.), provides a foundation for scientific collaboration. The next generation of the Jupyter web interface,&nbsp;JupyterLab,&nbsp;will combine in a single user interface not only the notebook but multiple other tools to access Jupyter services and remote computational resources and data.&nbsp; A flexible and responsive UI allows the user to mix Notebooks, terminals, text editors, graphical consoles and more, presenting in a single, unified environment the tools needed to work with a remote environment.&nbsp; Furthermore, the entire design is extensible and based on plugins that interoperate via open APIs, making it possible to design new plugins tailored to specific types of data or user needs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJupyterHub&nbsp;enables Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab to be used by groups of users for research collaboration and education. We believe JupyterHub provides a foundation on which to build modern scientific gateways that support a wide range of user scenarios, from interactive data exploration in high-level languages like Python, Julia or R, to the education of researchers and students whose work relies on traditional HPC resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe presenter discusses the benefits and applications of Jupyter Notebooks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nScroll to the bottom of the page to view the webinar.

The EDA allows users to build a stepwise visual representation of their experiment, providing feedback and dedicated support for randomization, blinding and sample size calculation. This demonstration will provide an introduction to the tool and provide guidance on getting started. Ultimately, the use of a tool such as the EDA will lead to carefully designed experiments that yield robust and reproducible data using the minimum number of animals consistent with scientific objectives.&nbsp;",

It also explains the scientific issues it addresses, and how the results of the TDM process can be queried and exploited by researchers through the Floril&egrave;ge application.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn recent years, developments in molecular technologies have led to an exponential growth of experimental data and publications, many of which are open, however accessible separately. Therefore, it is now crucial for researchers to have bioinformatics infrastructures at their disposal, that propose unified access to both data and related scientific articles. With the right text mining infrastructures and tools, application developers and data managers can rapidly access and process textual data, link them with other data and make the results available for scientists.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe text-mining process behind Florilege has been set up by INRA using the OpenMinTeD environment. It consists in extracting the relevant information, mostly textual, from scientific literature and databases. Words or word groups are identified and assigned a type, like&nbsp; &ldquo;habitat&rdquo; or &ldquo;taxon&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSections of the tutorial:<br />\r\n1. Biological motivation of the Florilege database<br />\r\n2. Floril&egrave;ge Use-Case on OpenMinTeD (includes a description of how to access the Habitat-Phenotype Relation Extractor for Microbes application)<br />\r\n3.

It has become essential to use databases (either analogue or digital) to turn this avalanche of data into usable information. A significant percentage of databases that are created do not repay the cost and effort of their creation and can therefore be considered to be failures. The probability of creating a successful database can be increased by careful consideration of a few simple questions. What is the objective that the database will meet? Why is a digital database being considered? When, if ever, will the cost and effort of creating the database be repaid? How will the database be designed and created? Where are the users? And finally, who will be responsible for maintaining the integrity of the database?&nbsp;&nbsp;",

We present the fundamental concepts underlying the quantitative techniques as a way of thinking, not just a way of calculating, in order to enhance decision-making skills.\u00a0Rather than survey all of the techniques of management science, we stress those fundamental concepts and tools that we believe are most important for the practical analysis of management decisions, presenting the material as much as possible in the context of realistic business situations from a variety of settings. Exercises and examples drawn from marketing, finance, operations management, strategy, and other management functions.\u00a0 Course features include selected lecture notes and problem set assignments with answers.\u00a0 Materials offered as course was presented in Summer 2003.\u00a0\u00a0",

      "abstract_data": "The United States spends billions of dollars every year to publicly support research that has resulted in critical innovations and new technologies. Unfortunately, the outcome of this work, published articles, only provides the story of the research and not the actual research itself. This often results in the publication of irreproducible studies or even falsified findings, and it requires significant resources to discern the good research from the bad. There is way to improve this process, however, and that is to publish both the article and the data supporting the research. Shared data helps researchers identify irreproducible results. Additionally, shared data can be reused in new ways to generate new innovations and technologies. We need researchers to &ldquo;React Differently&rdquo; with respect to their data to make the research process more efficient, transparent, and accountable to the public that funds them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKristin Briney is a Data Services Librarian at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. She has a Ph.D. in physical chemistry, a Masters in library and information studies, and currently works to help researchers manage their data better.

      "abstract_data": "Looking after digital data is central to good research. We all know of horror stories of people losing or deleting their entire dissertation just weeks prior to a deadline! But even before this happens, good practice in looking after research data from the beginning to the end of a project makes work and life a lot less stressful. Defined in the widest sense, digital data includes all files created or manipulated on a computer (text, images, spreadsheets, databases, etc). With publishing and archiving of research increasingly online we all have a responsibility to ensure the long-term preservation of archaeological data, while at same time being aware of issues of sensitive data, intellectual property rights, open access, and freedom of information.<br /><br />&#13;\nThe DataTrain teaching materials have been designed to familiarise post-graduate students in good practice in looking after their research data. A central tenet is the importance of thinking about this in conjunction with the projected outputs and publication of research projects. The eight presentations, followed by group discussion and written exercises, follow the lifecycle of digital data from pre-project planning, data creation, data management, publication, long-term preservation and lastly to issues of the re-use of digital data. At the same time the course follows the career path of researchers from post-graduate research students, through post-doctoral research projects, to larger collaborative and inter-disciplinary projects.<br /><br />&#13;\nThe teaching material is targeted at co-ordinators of Core Research Skills courses for first year post-graduate research students in archaeology. The material is open access and you are invited to re-use and amend the content as best suits the requirements of your university department. The complete course is designed to run either as a four hour half-day workshop, or 2 x 2 hour classes. Alternatively, individual modules can be slotted into existing data management and core research skills teaching.",

Project members can then upload files and folders and describe those resources using domain-specific and generic metadata, so it can suit a broad spectrum of data description needs. The contents of some files that contain data (Excel, CSV, for example) is automatically extracted, as well as text from others (PDF, Word, TXT, etc) to assist discovery.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDendro provides a flexible data description framework built on Linked Open Data at the core (triple store as), scalable file storage for handling big files, BagIt-represented backups, authentication with&nbsp;ORCID&nbsp;and sharing to practically any repository platform.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther information about Dendro can be found on its Github repository at:&nbsp;&nbsp;https://github.com/feup-infolab/dendro.&nbsp; Documentation and descriptions of Dendro can be found in other languages from the primary URL home page.",

MCARD-ExcersiceV1.0.pdf is an optional, summative assessment exercise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis module, funded as part of the wider JISC Managing Research Data programme as part of the Curating Artistic Research Output (CAiRO) Project, offers data management knowledge tailored to the special requirements of the creative arts researcher who is producing non-standard (i.e. non-textual) research outputs. The module aims to develop the development of skills required by arts researchers to effectively self-archive and then disseminate data made through research activities. The module can also help researchers to better understand data management issues and then communicate needs to third parties, such as institutional repositories, in order to negotiate appropriate levels of service.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDownloadable resources associated with this module include a zip file containing module content as stand alone .html files, a PDF of optional, summative exercise, and a PDF version of the introduction.&nbsp; Topics include:<br />\r\nUnit 1: Introducing art as research data<br />\r\nUnit 2: Creating art as research data<br />\r\nUnit 3: Managing art as research data<br />\r\nUnit 4: Delivering art as research data<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach unit has a suggested order (accessible via the navigation on the left of each page) and addition &lsquo;Focus on&rsquo; content which further illustrates topics covered in the main body.&nbsp; Module content can be accessed directly online at:&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20111001142018/http://www.projectcairo.org/module/unit1-0.html&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

The idea for &quot;Top 10 Data Things&quot; stems from initial work done at the Australian Research Data Commons or ARDC (formerly known as the Australian National Data Service).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Global Sprint was organised by Library Carpentry, Australian Research Data Commons and the Research Data Alliance Libraries for Research Data Interest Group in collaboration with FOSTER Open Science, OpenAire, RDA Europe, Data Management Training Clearinghouse, California Digital Library, Dryad, AARNet, Center for Digital Scholarship at the Leiden University, and DANS. Anyone could join the Sprint and roughly 25 groups/individuals participated from The Netherlands, Germany, Australia, United States, Hungary, Norway, Italy, and Belgium. See the full list of registered Sprinters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSprinters worked off of a primer that was provided in advance together with an online ARDC webinar introducing FAIR and the Sprint titled, &quot;Ready, Set, Go! Join the Top 10 FAIR Data Things Global Sprint.&quot; Groups/individuals developed their Things in Google docs which could be accessed and edited by all participants. The Sprinters also used a Zoom channel provided by ARDC, for online calls and coordination, and a Gitter channel, provided by Library Carpentry, to chat with each other throughout the two-days. In addition, participants used the Twitter hashtag #Top10FAIR to communicate with the broader community, sometimes including images of the day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParticipants greeted each other throughout the Sprint and created an overall welcoming environment. As the Sprint shifted to different timezones, it was a chance for participants to catch up. The Zoom and Gitter channels were a way for many to connect over FAIR but also discuss other topics. A number of participants did not know what to expect from a Library Carpentry/Carpentries-like event but found a welcoming environment where everyone could participate.",

The growing emphasis on data management practices in recent years has underscored the need for well-structured metadata to support the preservation and reuse of digital geographic information. Despite its value, creation of geospatial metadata is widely recognized as a complex and labor-intensive process, often creating a barrier to effective identification and evaluation of digital datasets. We will discuss our set of best practices for describing a variety of spatial content types using the ISO Series of Geographic Metadata Standards. We will share a series of Python and XSLT routines, which automate the creation of ISO-compliant metadata for geospatial datasets, web services, and feature catalogs. These auto-generation tools are designed to work directly with XML documents, making them suitable for use within any XML-aware cataloging platform. Our goals are to make metadata creation simpler for data providers, and to increase standardization across organizations in order to increase the potential for metadata sharing and data synchronization among the geospatial community.</div>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n",

Lack of proper data management practices can lead in extreme cases to irreversible loss of data. As a consequence, reproducibility of scientific experiments can be questioned. This in turn reduces trust in scientific findings and undermines reputation of researchers and their institutions. For this reason, excellent data management skills are nowadays an essential asset to successful researchers. This talk will introduce participants to Data Management Plans that help to plan how data is handled during experiments so that no data is lost, can easily be found, correctly interpreted using provided metadata, and properly licensed. Participants will learn about practical aspects of data management. They will also get familiar with research funder requirements for Data Management Plans that are becoming an obligatory project deliverable around the world.<br /><br />&#13;\nTopics covered:<br /><br />&#13;\n\u0095 Why good data management is important?<br /><br />&#13;\n\u0095 What are the Data Management Plans?<br /><br />&#13;\n\u0095 How to create a Data Management Plan?<br /><br />&#13;\n\u0095 What are the best data management practices?<br /><br />&#13;\n\u0095 How to make research data FAIR?<br /><br />&#13;\n\u0095 What are the funder requirements for Data Management Plans?<br /><br />&#13;\n\u0095 What does the future look like concerning data management?",

The DataTrain teaching materials have been designed to familiarise post-graduate students in good practice in looking after their research data. A central tenet is the importance of thinking about this in conjunction with the projected outputs and publication of research projects. The eight presentations, followed by group discussion and written exercises, follow the lifecycle of digital data from pre-project planning, data creation, data management, publication, long-term preservation and lastly to issues of the re-use of digital data. At the same time the course follows the career path of researchers from post-graduate research students, through post-doctoral research projects, to larger collaborative and inter-disciplinary projects. The teaching material is targeted at co-ordinators of Core Research Skills courses for first year post-graduate research students in archaeology. The material is open access and you are invited to re-use and amend the content as best suits the requirements of your university department. The complete course is designed to run either as a four hour half-day workshop, or 2 x 2 hour classes. Alternatively, individual modules can be slotted into existing data management and core research skills teaching.",

They are volunteers that act as advocates for good data management and sharing practises and they help their Faculty&rsquo;s Data Steward with disciplinary specific understandings of Research Data Management (RDM). The Data Champion programme started in September 2018 at the TU Delft and is open to researchers from all levels (PhD students to professors) as well as support staff (data managers, software developers and technicians). As the Data Champions are members of all faculties and various departments of Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) they form a network across the university campus. The Champions are invited for meetings where they interact with each other and share their experiences, such as achievements and problems that they encounter in managing data and software. They are also encouraged to participate at a national and international level by being informed on current trends in data management and there is a travel grant available that allows them to participate in RDM events, trainings and workshops. At TU Delft they are actively working together with the Data Stewards on RDM policy development as well as involved in more practical activities such as coding support and Software Carpentry workshops. These activities increase the visibility and impact of the Data Champions, recognise their data management efforts, and offer them opportunities to learn new skills which they can share with their local community members.",

Training materials in digital preservation have been designed to slot into existing training courses on related areas, such as Information Literacy and reference management. Five short modules provide an introduction to why digital preservation matters, and cover the issues of safe storage of digital materials, documentation and metadata, data sharing and re-use and data management planning, to think about these issues early in the research process. The resources consist of a series of slides for each module, and a guide on how the resources can be used, including suggested discussion questions and script for use with the slides.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLicence:&nbsp;Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales",

You can upload your own raster/vector data which can be kept private or made publicly available.<br />\r\nThis Get Started guide is intended as a quick way to start programming with the Earth Engine JavaScript API. The Earth Engine documentation is primarily structured by data type. For example, the left side navigation contains links to sections or pages about important data types such as Image, Image Collection, Feature, Feature Collection, Geometry, Reducer, Chart, Join and Array. This guide only describes only enough about these types to get you started. There are also sections for machine learning, specialized or sensor-specific algorithms (e.g. Landsat algorithms), public-facing apps, data (asset) management and important details about Earth Engine internal workings.",

      "abstract_data": "Jupyter Notebooks are composite digital objects used to develop, share, view, and execute interspersed, interlinked, and interactive documentation, equations, visualizations, and code. Researchers seeking to deposit software, in this case Jupyter Notebooks, in repositories do so with the expectation that repositories will provide documentation explaining &ldquo;what you can deposit, the supported file formats for deposits, what metadata you may need to provide, how to provide this metadata and what happens after you make your deposit&rdquo; (Jackson, 2018a). This expectation is not necessarily met by repositories that currently accept software deposits and complex objects like Jupyter Notebooks. This guide is meant to both inform curatorial practices around Jupyter Notebooks, and support the development of resources that meet researchers&rsquo; expectations to ensure long-term availability of software in curated archival repositories. Guidance provided by Jisc and the Software Sustainability Institute outlines three different kinds of software deposits: a minimal deposit, a runnable deposit, and a comprehensive deposit (Jackson, 2018b). This primer follows this same conceptual framework in dealing with Jupyter Notebooks, which even in their static, non-executable form, can be used to document how scientific research was carried out or be used as teaching models among many other use cases.<br />\r\nThis work was created as part of the Data Curation Network &ldquo;Specialized Data Curation&rdquo; Workshop #1 co-located with the Digital Library Federation (DLF) Forum 2018 in Las Vegas, Nevada on October 17-18, 2018.<br />\r\n&nbsp;",

      "abstract_data": "In many disciplines, data are highly decentralized across thousands of online databases (repositories, registries, and knowledgebases). Wringing value from such databases depends on the discipline of data science and on the humble bricks and mortar that make integration possible; identifiers are a core component of this integration infrastructure. Drawing on authors experience and on work by other groups, they outline 10 lessons that have learned about the identifier qualities and best practices that facilitate large-scale data integration. Specifically, they propose actions that identifier practitioners (database providers) should take in the design, provision and reuse of identifiers. They also outline the important considerations for those referencing identifiers in various circumstances, including by authors and data generators. While the importance and relevance of each lesson will vary by context, there is a need for increased awareness about how to avoid and manage common identifier problems, especially those related to persistence and web-accessibility/resolvability. They focus strongly on web-based identifiers in the life sciences; however, the principles are broadly relevant to other disciplines.",

With the rate at which network analysis is developing, there will soon be more user-friendly ways to produce similar visualizations and analyses, as well as entirely new metrics of interest. For these reasons, this tutorial focuses as much on the principles behind creating, visualizing, and analyzing temporal networks (the &ldquo;why&rdquo;) as it does on the particular technical means by which we achieve these goals (the &ldquo;how&rdquo;). It also highlights some of the unhappy oversimplifications that historians may have to make when preparing their data for temporal network analysis, an area where our discipline may actually suggest new directions for temporal network analysis research.<br />\r\nOne of the most basic forms of historical argument is to identify, describe, and analyze changes in a phenomenon or set of phenomena as they occur over a period of time. The premise of this tutorial is that when historians study networks, we should, insofar as it is possible, also be acknowledging and investigating how networks change over time.<br />\r\nLesson Goals<br />\r\nIn this tutorial you will learn:<br />\r\n-The types of data necessary to model a temporal network<br />\r\n-How to visualize a temporal network using the NDTV package in R<br />\r\n-How to quantify and visualize some important network-level and node-level metrics that describe temporal networks using the TSNA package in R",

You may have heard about tf-idf in the context of topic modeling, machine learning, or other approaches to text analysis. Tf-idf comes up a lot in published work because it&rsquo;s both a corpus exploration method and a pre-processing step for many other text-mining measures and models.<br />\r\nLooking closely at tf-idf will leave you with an immediately applicable text analysis method. This lesson will also introduce you to some of the questions and concepts of computationally oriented text analysis. Namely, this lesson addresses how you can isolate a document&rsquo;s most important words from the kinds of words that tend to be highly frequent across a set of documents in that language. In addition to tf-idf, there are a number of computational methods for determining which words or phrases characterize a set of documents, and I highly recommend Ted Underwood&rsquo;s 2011 blog post as a supplement.",

      "abstract_data": "This lesson offers a brief and concise introduction to Linked Open Data (LOD). No prior knowledge is assumed. Readers should gain a clear understanding of the concepts behind linked open data, how it is used, and how it is created. The tutorial is split into five parts, plus further reading:<br />\r\n-Linked open data: what is it?<br />\r\n-The role of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)<br />\r\n-How LOD organizes knowledge: ontologies<br />\r\n-The Resource Description Framework (RDF) and data formats<br />\r\n-Querying linked open data with SPARQL<br />\r\n-Further reading and resources<br />\r\nThe tutorial should take a couple of hours to complete, and you may find it helpful to re-read sections to solidify your understanding. Technical terms have been linked to their corresponding page on Wikipedia, and you are encouraged to pause and read about terms that you find challenging. After having learned some of the key principles of LOD, the best way to improve and solidify that knowledge is to practice. This tutorial provides opportunities to do so. By the end of the course you should understand the basics of LOD, including key terms and concepts.<br />\r\nIn order to provide readers with a solid grounding in the basic principles of LOD, this tutorial will not be able to offer a comprehensive coverage of all LOD concepts. The following two LOD concepts will not be the focus of this lesson:<br />\r\nThe semantic web and semantic reasoning of datasets. A semantic reasoner would deduce that George VI is the brother or half-brother of Edward VIII, given the fact that a) Edward VIII is the son of George V and b) George VI is the son of George V. This tutorial does not focus on this type of task.<br />\r\nCreating and uploading linked open datasets to the linked data cloud. Sharing your LOD is an important principle, which is encouraged below. However, the practicalities of contributing your LOD to the linked data cloud are beyond the scope of this lesson. Some resources that can help you get started with this task are available at the end of this tutorial.",

This tutorial explains how to extract network data (people, institutions, places, etc) from historical sources through the use of non-technical methods developed in Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) and Social Network Analysis (SNA), and how to visualize this data with the platform-independent and particularly easy-to-use Palladio.<br />\r\nThis tutorial will focus on data extraction from unstructured text and shows one way to visualize it using Palladio. It is purposefully designed to be as simple and robust as possible. For the limited scope of this tutorial it will suffice to say that an actor refers to the persons, institutions, etc. which are the object of study and which are connected by relations. Within the context of a network visualization or computation (also called graph), we call them nodes and we call the connections ties. In all cases it is important to remember that nodes and ties are drastically simplified models used to represent the complexities of past events, and in themselves do not always suffice to generate insight. But it is likely that the graph will highlight interesting aspects, challenge your hypothesis and/or lead you to generate new ones. Network diagrams become meaningful when they are part of a dialogue with data and other sources of information.",

In the current scenario it is very useful for dealing with marine met data as patterns, trends and correlations that might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier with data visualization software.<br />\r\nThe current course will demonstrate the use of open-source software FERRET for the generation of NetCDF data and visualize various types of plots, save and reuse them at a later stage. The course is designed to be a mix of both practical and theoretical sessions.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAims and Objectives<br />\r\n-Provide exposure to Data Visualization using FERRET.<br />\r\n-Generation of scripts to visualize various types of data sets (1D, 2D, 3D, etc.).<br />\r\n-Perform data analysis, generate added-value products.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nLearning Outcomes<br />\r\n-Knowledge and understanding of FERRET software.<br />\r\n-Generation of different types of JNL scripts for visualization and analysis.<br />\r\n-Able to visualize data set viz., in situ, remote sensing and model outputs.<br />\r\n-Tools for visualizing different types of ocean data and data products.",

We will run the topic modeler on some example files, and look at the kinds of outputs that MALLET installed.

      "abstract_data": "It has been recognized for some time now that sharing data is critical when publishing research findings. Scientific data repositories and networks such as DataONE provide researchers with ways to share and publish research data, bundled with appropriate metadata to allow peers to interpret and reuse the data products associated with research papers. Increasingly, the need to share code (i.e., scripts and analysis programs) used in the generation, analysis, and visualization of data---alongside the data products---has been recognized as well. However, it remains challenging (if not impossible) for many potential users of a research object to deal with the installation of complex software dependencies and the appropriate parameterization and execution of multiple scripts contained in often complicated, nested research objects. A key objective of the NSF-funded Whole Tale project is to make the development, sharing, and reuse of reproducible research objects more seamless, both for creators and users of &quot;tales&quot;. Tales can be seen as a special kind of research object that bundle data and metadata, but also code and the runtime execution environment necessary to reproduce the computational aspects of a research paper. In particular, a human-centered narrative, e.g., in the form of a Jupyter (or RStudio) notebook can be used as the central element of research tales that interleave scientific explanations, code, and visualizations. By making it easier to develop, package, share, and execute tales, different types of users are supported by the Whole Tale approach: researchers can easily combine data from different sources (e.g., DataONE member nodes), analyze and visualize the data, and then bundle up their research products---together with the software environment used to generate the products---and share the resulting tales. Peers can use the shared tales, e.g., as part of a review process (associated with a scientific publication) or make it the basis for their own research. In this webinar, we will illustrate the Whole Tale approach using a number of simple examples and demonstrations.",

      "abstract_data": "It has been recognized for some time now that sharing data is critical when publishing research findings. Scientific data repositories and networks such as DataONE provide researchers with ways to share and publish research data, bundled with appropriate metadata to allow peers to interpret and reuse the data products associated with research papers. Increasingly, the need to share code (i.e., scripts and analysis programs) used in the generation, analysis, and visualization of data---alongside the data products---has been recognized as well. However, it remains challenging (if not impossible) for many potential users of a research object to deal with the installation of complex software dependencies and the appropriate parameterization and execution of multiple scripts contained in often complicated, nested research objects. A key objective of the NSF-funded Whole Tale project is to make the development, sharing, and reuse of reproducible research objects more seamless, both for creators and users of &quot;tales&quot;. Tales can be seen as a special kind of research object that bundle data and metadata, but also code and the runtime execution environment necessary to reproduce the computational aspects of a research paper. In particular, a human-centered narrative, e.g., in the form of a Jupyter (or RStudio) notebook can be used as the central element of research tales that interleave scientific explanations, code, and visualizations. By making it easier to develop, package, share, and execute tales, different types of users are supported by the Whole Tale approach: researchers can easily combine data from different sources (e.g., DataONE member nodes), analyze and visualize the data, and then bundle up their research products---together with the software environment used to generate the products---and share the resulting tales.

The land management SDGs call for consistent tracking of land cover metrics. These metrics include productivity, land cover, soil carbon, urban expansion, and more. This webinar series will highlight a tool that uses NASA Earth Observations to track land degradation and urban development that meet the appropriate SDG targets.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSDGs 11 and 15 relate to sustainable urbanization and land use and cover change. SDG 11 aims to &quot;make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.&quot; SDG 15 aims to &quot;combat desertification, drought, and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation neutral world.&quot; To assess progress towards these goals, indicators have been established, many of which can be monitored using remote sensing.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this training, attendees will learn to use a freely-available QGIS plugin, Trends.Earth, created by Conservation International (CI) and have special guest speakers from the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and UN Habitat. Trends.Earth allows users to plot time series of key land change indicators. Attendees will learn to produce maps and figures to support monitoring and reporting on land degradation, improvement, and urbanization for SDG indicators 15.3.1 and 11.3.1. Each part of the webinar series will feature a presentation and a hands-on exercise.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Learning Objectives:</strong>&nbsp;By the end of this training, attendees will:&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Become familiar with SDG Indicators 15.3.1 and 11.3.1</li>\r\n\t<li>Understand the basics on how to compute sub indicators of SDG 15.3.1 such as: productivity, land cover, and soil carbon&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Understand how to use the Trends.Earth Urban Mapper web interface</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn the basics of the Trends.Earth toolkit including:&nbsp;\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Plotting time series&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Downloading data</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Use default or custom data for productivity, land cover, and soil organic carbon</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Calculate a SDG 15.3.1 spatial layers and summary table&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Calculate urban change metrics</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Create urban change summary tables</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Course Format:</strong>&nbsp;This training has been developed in partnership with&nbsp;Conservation International,&nbsp;United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and&nbsp;UN Habitat.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Three, 1.5-hour sessions that include lectures, hands-on exercises, and a question and answer sessio</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>?</strong><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Complete&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arset.gsfc.nasa.gov/webinars/fundamentals-remote-sensing\">Sessions 1 &amp; 2A of Fundamentals of Remote Sensing</a>, or equivalent experience&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html\">Download and install QGIS</a>, version 2.18.15\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Use this exercise for help:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arset.gsfc.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/land/webinars/Advanced_Land_Classification/ARSET_Downloading_Installing_QGIS_Final.pdf\">Downloading and Installing QGIS</a></li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Download and install the Trends.Earth software.

First off, you&rsquo;ll start with a short overview of the importance of learning SQL for jobs in data science, and next, you&rsquo;ll first learn more about how SQL query processing and execution so that you can adequately understand the importance of writing qualitative queries: more specifically, you&rsquo;ll see that the query is parsed, rewritten, optimized and finally evaluated. You&rsquo;ll also learn more about the set-based versus the procedural approach to querying. You&rsquo;ll briefly go more into time complexity and the big O notation to get an idea about the time complexity of an execution plan before you execute your query; Lastly, You&#39;ll briefly get some pointers on how you can tune your query further.</div>\r\n",

      "abstract_data": "<div class=\"rtejustify\">Multi-view data are extensively accessible nowadays, since various types of features, viewpoints, and different sensors. For example, the most popular commercial depth sensor Kinect uses both visible light and near-infrared sensors for depth estimation; automatic driving uses both visual and radar sensors to produce real-time 3D information on the road, and face analysis algorithms prefer face images from different views for high-fidelity reconstruction and recognition. All of them tend to facilitate better data representation in different application scenarios. Essentially, multiple features attempt to uncover various knowledge within each view to alleviate the final tasks, since each view would preserve both shared and private information. This becomes increasingly common in the era of &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; where the data are on large-scale, subject to corruption, generated from multiple sources, and have complex structures. While these problems attracted substantial research attention recently, a systematic overview of multi-view learning for Big Data analysis has never been given. In the face of big data and challenging real-world applications, we summarize and go through the most recent multi-view learning techniques appropriate to different data-driven problems. Specifically, our tutorial covers most multi-view data representation approaches, centered around two major applications along with Big Data, i.e., multi-view clustering, multi-view classification. In addition, it discusses current and upcoming challenges. This would benefit the community in both industry and academia from literature review to future directions.</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"rtejustify\"><br />\r\nThis tutorial is one of nine tutorials from the 2018 IEEE international conference on BIG DATA in Seattle WA, also you reach out to the others at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2018/Tutorials.html#tutorial1\">IEEE Big Data 2018 Tutorials</a>.</div>\r\n",

      "abstract_data": "<div class=\"rtejustify\">Institution X likes to use Dublin Core and enjoys occasionally storing coordinates in the dc: rights field along with normal rights statements. Institution Y prefers PBCore and dabbles in storing LCSH subject strings as a type of corporation. What happens when the time comes for these two institutions to put their data in a shared environment? These are the issues the Boston Public Library has been facing building a statewide digital repository for Massachusetts made up of items from dozens of organizations that each have their own way of doing metadata. This talk is on the Digital Commonwealth initiative and our role as a DPLA hub, lessons learned while dealing with other institutions&#39; data, and how we manage a repository system that contains actual digitized objects alongside metadata-only harvested records. In addition, a portion of this talk is on breaking the conventional library wisdom of &quot;dumbing down&quot; data to the lowest common denominator in a shared context. Instead, we go in the opposite direction: we make what we take in much more rich and discoverable by linking terms to controlled vocabularies, parsing subjects for geographic information, parsing potential dates from various fields into a standard format, and more.</div>\r\n",

Popular file formats can be tested, including SPSS, Stata, SAS, and CSV. The test configuration feature allows the creation of your own unique Data Quality Profile, which can play a useful role in your &lsquo;FAIR&rsquo; data checking.<br />\r\nThe webinar will describe the tests that are included in the tool, how to configure these to meet your own quality thresholds, and how to download the software from our GitHub page. they will also show their teaching exercise using messy data that can help promote data management skills.",

AD is difficult, because it is typically performed in an unlabeled context, taking only the internal structure of the dataset into account. Anomalous data might be the most interesting data in a particular data set, or it might represent garbage; and can arise from a plurality of sources &ndash; noise, stuck sensors, a different underlying system, an unusual mode of operation, and so on. This Tutorial will focus on the concepts and algorithms of AD for PHM data, with real-world examples and advice on algorithm selection for practical tasks.</div>\r\n",

We will zoom in on data integration techniques, data quality, and data governance. As companies often end up with many information systems and databases over time, the aspect of data integration becomes increasingly important to consolidate a company&rsquo;s data to provide one, unified view to applications and users. Hence, constructing a data warehouse is one area where data integration will be an important concern, but data integration is also important for many other use cases. In what follows, we will discuss different patterns for data integration. We will also focus on techniques to efficiently search unstructured data, both within and intra-enterprise data integration setting and across the worldwide web.<br />\r\nData integration is also heavily related to data quality, so we will discuss this managerial concern, and master data management. Finally, we look at data governance standards that help companies to set up initiatives to measure, monitor and improve data integration and quality practices.",

Typically the data concerned are sensitive data, and large numbers of people are involved. These studies represent a high cost in terms of resources required to perform all analyses and to get the results in a form where they can be used for research, but also from the personal perspective of participants sharing their data. At the same time, many different researchers should be enabled to make use of the data, maximizing the return on all these investments. This context provides many challenges in protecting the privacy of participants, protection of the data from illegitimate access, and enabling legitimate use.<br />\r\nthe speaker will address these challenges, which are multidisciplinary by nature, with a special focus on a privacy-friendly research data repository that is currently being developed by an iHub team, in cooperation with several large cohort studies on the Radboud university campus.",

      "abstract_data": "<div class=\"rtejustify\">The year 2020 is the 40th anniversary of the U.S. National Science Foundation&#39;s LTER Program, which has grown from a loosely organized set of research projects to a dynamic network of 28 sustained research programs across 18 major biomes. Hypothesis-driven, place-based research has been the Network&#39;s bread and butter throughout its 40-year history. Approaches to cross-site synthesis have varied through time, yet collaborative synthesis is essential for understanding the generality of site-based insights, scaling the results, and making them useful for modeling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA recent update of the LTER Network bibliography makes it possible to approach the question of &quot;what works&quot; to facilitate collaboration at both the site- and the network-level. Our analysis shows that between 1980 and 2019, the average number of LTER-based publications per site per year grew from 6 to more than 30. For the first 10-15 years of the Network&#39;s history, the number of authors and institutions per publication was similar to a comparable sample of non-LTER publications. But the pace of collaboration accelerated rapidly between 1995 and 2019. Today, LTER papers involve nearly twice as many authors and institutions as comparable non-LTER publications. Site tenure and ecosystem type are predictably strong drivers of collaboration in the LTER Network. Researcher mobility emerged as an unexpected source of collaboration that merits further investigation.</div>\r\n",

      "abstract_data": "<div class=\"rtejustify\">The OpenAIRE project supports the open science ambitions of the European Commission. The project and in particular the Research Data Management team provide support, training, and information on the Open Research Data Pilot. In this context, a survey was carried out to collect feedback on the Horizon 2020 template for Data Management Plans (DMPs). The team collaborated with the FAIR data expert group, which is providing recommendations to the European Commission on Turning FAIR data into reality. One of the specific tasks of the Expert Group is contributing to an evaluation of the Horizon 2020 approach to DMPs, including future revisions of the template and the development of additional sector/ discipline-specific guidance. The aim of the survey was to collect experiences of researchers and DMP reviewers with the DMP template and guidelines on FAIR data management in Horizon 2020. The survey assesses the usefulness of the guidelines and any aspects that are confusing and unclear to determine what improvements can be made.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeedback was sought from both researchers and research support staff. The survey was initially scheduled to run from 22 May to 21 June 2017. Several organizations were asked to help announce the survey, including OpenAIRE&rsquo;s National Open Access Desks, the FAIR data expert group, FOSTER, LIBER, and the RDA Interest Group on Active DMPs. When the first survey responses showed only a small share of researchers,&nbsp; more stakeholders were contacted to specifically target this community. The European Research Area was approached, whose project officers circulated the survey call among award holders of EC projects. Early-career researchers were also informed through the YEAR network and EURODOC. This resulted in an extension of the survey to 21 July 2017.</div>\r\n",
