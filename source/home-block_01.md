# Welcome to the Data Management Training Clearinghouse! 

The Data Management Training Clearinghouse (DMTC) is a registry for online learning resources focusing on data skills and capacity building for research data management, data stewardship and data education.  The DMTC was launched in a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey's Community for Data Integration, the Earth Sciences Information Partnership (ESIP), and DataONE in 2016.  

The DMTC continues to be supported by ESIP, the Institute of Museum & Library Services (IMLS), and the Science Gateway Community Institute (SGCI).
